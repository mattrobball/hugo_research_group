abstract: 'We leverage the results of the prequel in combination with a theorem of
  D.

  Orlov to yield some results in Hodge theory of derived categories of

  factorizations and derived categories of coherent sheaves on varieties. In

  particular, we provide a conjectural geometric framework to further understand

  M. Kontsevich''s Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture. We obtain new cases of

  a conjecture of Orlov concerning the Rouquier dimension of the bounded derived

  category of coherent sheaves on a smooth variety. Further, we introduce actions

  of $A$-graded commutative rings on triangulated categories and their associated

  Noether-Lefschetz spectra as a new invariant of triangulated categories. They

  are intended to encode information about algebraic classes in the cohomology of

  an algebraic variety. We provide some examples to motivate the connection.'
