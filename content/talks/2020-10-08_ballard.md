title: Rationality and exceptional collections for toric varieties
abstract: A conjecture of Orlov asks whether all varieties with full exceptional collections are rational. We will discuss two interpretations of this question over non-closed fields. The strict one, where End(E)=k is the definition of exceptional for X over k, holds for toric varieties over a general field. The looser one, End(E)/k is a separable extension of fields, does not guarantee the existence of a k-point much less rationality. The work discussed is joint with Alexander Duncan, Alicia Lamarche, and Patrick McFaddin.
