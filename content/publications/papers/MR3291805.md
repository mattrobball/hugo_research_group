abstract: 'We give a simple formula for the essential dimension of a finite

  pseudo-reflection group at a prime p and determine the absolute essential

  dimension for most irreducible pseudo-reflection groups. We also study the

  "poor man''s essential dimension" of an arbitrary finite group, an intermediate

  notion between the absolute essential dimension and the essential dimension at

  a prime p.'
