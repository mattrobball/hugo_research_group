abstract: "When monic integral polynomials of degree $n \\geq 2$ are ordered by the\n\
  maximum of the absolute value of their coefficients, the Hilbert irreducibility\n\
  theorem implies that asymptotically 100% are irreducible and have Galois group\n\
  isomorphic to $S_n$. In particular, amongst such polynomials whose coefficients\n\
  are bounded by $B$ in absolute value, asymptotically $(1+o(1))(2B+1)^n$ are\nirreducible\
  \ and have Galois group $S_n$. When $G$ is a proper transitive\nsubgroup of $S_n$,\
  \ however, the asymptotic count of polynomials with Galois\ngroup $G$ has been determined\
  \ only in very few cases.\n  Here, we show that if there are strong upper bounds\
  \ on the number of degree\n$n$ fields with Galois group $G$, then there are also\
  \ strong bounds on the\nnumber of polynomials with Galois group $G$. For example,\
  \ for any prime $p$, we\nshow that there are at most $O(B^{3 - \\frac{2}{p}} (\\\
  log B)^{p - 1})$\npolynomials with Galois group $C_p$ and coefficients bounded by\
  \ $B$."
