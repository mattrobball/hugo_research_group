abstract: 'We study the relationship between derived categories of factorizations
  on

  gauged Landau-Ginzburg models related by variations of the linearization in

  Geometric Invariant Theory. Under assumptions on the variation, we show the

  derived categories are comparable by semi-orthogonal decompositions and

  describe the complementary components. We also verify a question posed by

  Kawamata: we show that $D$-equivalence and $K$-equivalence coincide for such

  variations. The results are applied to obtain a simple inductive description of

  derived categories of coherent sheaves on projective toric Deligne-Mumford

  stacks. This recovers Kawamata''s theorem that all projective toric

  Deligne-Mumford stacks have full exceptional collections. Using similar

  methods, we prove that the Hassett moduli spaces of stable

  symmetrically-weighted rational curves also possess full exceptional

  collections. As a final application, we show how our results recover Orlov''s

  $\sigma$-model/Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence.'
