abstract: 'For a wide class of Dirichlet series associated to automorphic forms, we
  show

  that those without Euler products must have zeros within the region of absolute

  convergence. For instance, we prove that if f is a classical holomorphic

  modular form whose L-function does not vanish for Re(s) > (k+1)/2, then f is a

  Hecke eigenform. Our proof adapts and extends work of Saias and Weingartner,

  who proved a similar result for degree 1 L-functions.'
