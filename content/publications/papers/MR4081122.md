abstract: "In a companion paper, we developed an efficient algebraic method for\n\
  computing the Fourier transforms of certain functions defined on prehomogeneous\n\
  vector spaces over finite fields, and we carried out these computations in a\nvariety\
  \ of cases.\n  Here we develop a method, based on Fourier analysis and algebraic\
  \ geometry,\nwhich exploits these Fourier transform formulas to yield level of distribution\n\
  results, in the sense of analytic number theory. Such results are of the shape\n\
  typically required for a variety of sieve methods. As an example of such an\napplication\
  \ we prove that there are $\\gg$ X/log(X) quartic fields whose\ndiscriminant is\
  \ squarefree, bounded above by X, and has at most eight prime\nfactors."
