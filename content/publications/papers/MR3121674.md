abstract: 'We introduce the notion of orbital L-functions for the space of binary
  cubic

  forms and investigate their analytic properties. We study their functional

  equations and residue formulas in some detail. Aside from the intrinsic

  interest, results from this paper are used to prove the existence of secondary

  terms in counting functions for cubic fields. This is worked out in a companion

  paper (arXiv:1102.2914).'
