abstract: 'We prove that the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves with proper

  support is equivalent to the category of locally-finite, cohomological functors

  on the perfect derived category of a quasi-projective scheme over a field. We

  introduce the notions of pseudo-adjoints and Rouquier functors and study them.

  As an application of these ideas and results, we extend the reconstruction

  result of Bondal and Orlov to Gorenstein projective varieties.'
