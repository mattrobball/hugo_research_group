abstract: "In previous work, Ohno conjectured, and Nakagawa proved, relations between\n\
  the counting functions of certain cubic fields. These relations may be viewed\n\
  as complements to the Scholz reflection principle, and Ohno and Nakagawa\ndeduced\
  \ them as consequences of `extra functional equations' involving the\nShintani zeta\
  \ functions associated to the prehomogeneous vector space of binary\ncubic forms.\n\
  \  In the present paper we generalize their result by proving a similar identity\n\
  relating certain degree l fields with Galois groups D_l and F_l respectively,\n\
  for any odd prime l, and in particular we give another proof of the\nOhno-Nakagawa\
  \ relation without appealing to binary cubic forms."
