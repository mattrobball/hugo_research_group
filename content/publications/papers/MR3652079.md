abstract: 'We remove the global quotient presentation input in the theory of windows
  in

  derived categories of smooth Artin stacks of finite type. As an application, we

  use existing results on flipping of strata for wall-crossing of Gieseker

  semi-stable torsion-free sheaves of rank two on rational surfaces to produce

  semi-orthogonal decompositions relating the different moduli stacks. The

  complementary pieces of these semi-orthogonal decompositions are derived

  categories of products of Hilbert schemes of points on the surface.'
