abstract: "In this note, we prove a power-saving remainder term for the function\n\
  counting $S_3$-sextic number fields. We also give a prediction on the second\nmain\
  \ term.\n  We also present numerical data on counting functions for $S_3$-sextic\
  \ number\nfields. Our data indicates that our prediction is likely to be correct,\
  \ and it\nalso suggests the existence of additional lower order terms which we have\
  \ not\nyet been able to explain."
