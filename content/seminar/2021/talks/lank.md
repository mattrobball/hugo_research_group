title: Line Bundle-Valued Quadratic Forms
abstract: Within this talk, we will introduce what are called line bundle-valued quadratic forms over schemes and cover a few examples. It will be shown that many familiar constructions from the theory of quadratic forms over rings and linear algebra generalize to the category of schemes. Many of these ideas are applicable to vector bundles over such an object, and this is where much of the talk will take place.
