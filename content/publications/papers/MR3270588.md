abstract: "We provide a factorization model for the continuous internal Hom, in the\n\
  homotopy category of $k$-linear dg-categories, between dg-categories of\nequivariant\
  \ factorizations. This motivates a notion, similar to that of\nKuznetsov, which\
  \ we call the extended Hochschild cohomology algebra of the\ncategory of equivariant\
  \ factorizations. In some cases of geometric interest,\nextended Hochschild cohomology\
  \ contains Hochschild cohomology as a subalgebra\nand Hochschild homology as a homogeneous\
  \ component. We use our factorization\nmodel for the internal Hom to calculate the\
  \ extended Hochschild cohomology for\nequivariant factorizations on affine space.\n\
  \  Combining the computation of extended Hochschild cohomology with the\nHochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg\
  \ isomorphism and a theorem of Orlov recovers and\nextends Griffiths' classical\
  \ description of the primitive cohomology of a\nsmooth, complex projective hypersurface\
  \ in terms of homogeneous pieces of the\nJacobian algebra. In the process, the primitive\
  \ cohomology is identified with\nthe fixed subspace of the cohomological endomorphism\
  \ associated to an\ninteresting endofunctor of the bounded derived category of coherent\
  \ sheaves on\nthe hypersurface. We also demonstrate how to understand the whole\
  \ Jacobian\nalgebra as morphisms between kernels of endofunctors of the derived\
  \ category.\n  Finally, we present a bootstrap method for producing algebraic cycles\
  \ in\ncategories of equivariant factorizations. As proof of concept, we show how\
  \ this\nreproves the Hodge conjecture for all self-products of a particular K3 surface\n\
  closely related to the Fermat cubic fourfold."
