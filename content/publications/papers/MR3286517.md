abstract: 'Shiu proved that if a and q are arbitrary coprime integers, then there
  exist

  arbitrarily long strings of consecutive primes which are all congruent to a

  modulo q. We generalize Shiu''s theorem to imaginary quadratic fields, where we

  prove the existence of "bubbles" containing arbitrarily many primes which are

  all, up to units, congruent to a modulo q.'
