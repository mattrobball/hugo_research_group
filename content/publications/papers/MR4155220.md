abstract: 'We prove the first known nontrivial bounds on the sizes of the 2-torsion

  subgroups of the class groups of cubic and higher degree number fields $K$ (the

  trivial bound being $O_{\epsilon}(|{\rm Disc}(K)|^{1/2+\epsilon})$ by

  Brauer--Siegel). This yields corresponding improvements to: 1) bounds of Brumer

  and Kramer on the sizes of 2-Selmer groups and ranks of elliptic curves; 2)

  bounds of Helfgott and Venkatesh on the number of integral points on elliptic

  curves; 3) bounds on the sizes of 2-Selmer groups and ranks of Jacobians of

  hyperelliptic curves; and 4) bounds of Baily and Wong on the number of

  $A_4$-quartic fields of bounded discriminant.'
