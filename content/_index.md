# Welcome to the SC AGNT group

We are a dynamic research group from the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.sc.edu) at the [University of South Carolina](http://www.sc.edu). Our aim is to explore and understand questions dating back [thousands of years](https://math.berkeley.edu/~wodzicki/160.F05/HistIntr.pdf). <!--Find a better link here -->

<!-- Replace this description with something appropriate for the group

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).-->
