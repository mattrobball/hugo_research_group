abstract: 'We develop a generalization of the $Q$-construction of the first author,

  Diemer, and the third author for Grassmann flips. This generalization provides

  a canonical idempotent kernel on the derived category of the associated global

  quotient stack. The idempotent kernel, after restriction, induces a

  semi-orthogonal decomposition which compares the flipped varieties. Furthermore

  its image, after restriction to the geometric invariant theory semistable

  locus, "opens" a canonical "window" in the derived category of the quotient

  stack. We check this window coincides with the set of representations used by

  Kapranov to form a full exceptional collection on Grassmannians.'
