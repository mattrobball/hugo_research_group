abstract: 'A variety X with an action of a finite group G is said to be G-unirational
  if

  there is a G-equivariant dominant rational map V -> X where V is a faithful

  linear representation of G. This generalizes the usual notion of

  unirationality. We determine when X is G-unirational for any complex del Pezzo

  surface X of degree at least 3.'
