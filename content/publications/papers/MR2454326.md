abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce the interested reader to homological mirror

  symmetry. After recalling a little background knowledge, we tackle the simplest

  cases of homological mirror symmetry: curves of genus zero and one. We close by

  outlining the current state of the field and mentioning what homo- logical

  mirror symmetry has to say about other aspects of mirror symmetry.'
