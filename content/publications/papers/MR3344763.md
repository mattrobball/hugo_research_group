abstract: 'We formalize and study several competing notions of versality for an action

  of a linear algebraic group on an algebraic variety X. Our main result is that

  these notions of versality are equivalent to various statements concerning

  rational points on twisted forms of X (existence of rational points, existence

  of a dense set of rational points, etc.) We give applications of this

  equivalence in both directions, to study versality of group actions and

  rational points on algebraic varieties. We obtain similar results on

  p-versality for a prime integer p. An appendix, containing a letter from J.-P.

  Serre, puts the notion of versality in a historical perspective.'
