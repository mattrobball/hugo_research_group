title: An introduction to Weil divisors
abstract: Given a variety , we can associate to it a group of Weil divisors, namely, the free abelian group generated by the irreducible closed subvarieties of codimension one. The divisor class group is then constructed as the quotient of this group by the subgroup of principal divisors, and this class group is an interesting and subtle invariant of a variety. Though the majority of the talk will deal with Weil divisors on curves, I intend to briefly elucidate the connection between the divisor class group on schemes and the familiar ideal class group of a number field within the field of algebraic number theory. If time permits, I will end the talk with an example in which a subgroup of the divisor class group closely corresponds to the group structure on the closed points of a particular elliptic curve. The majority of the information contained in the talk is taken directly from section 2.6 of Hartshorne’s “Algebraic Geometry.”
