abstract: 'The Orlov spectrum is a new invariant of a triangulated category. It was

  introduced by D. Orlov building on work of A. Bondal-M. van den Bergh and R.

  Rouquier. The supremum of the Orlov spectrum of a triangulated category is

  called the ultimate dimension. In this work, we study Orlov spectra of

  triangulated categories arising in mirror symmetry. We introduce the notion of

  gaps and outline their geometric significance. We provide the first large class

  of examples where the ultimate dimension is finite: categories of singularities

  associated to isolated hypersurface singularities. Similarly, given any nonzero

  object in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth

  Calabi-Yau hypersurface, we produce a new generator by closing the object under

  a certain monodromy action and uniformly bound this new generator''s generation

  time. In addition, we provide new upper bounds on the generation times of

  exceptional collections and connect generation time to braid group actions to

  provide a lower bound on the ultimate dimension of the derived Fukaya category

  of a symplectic surface of genus greater than one.'
