abstract: "Let $k$ be a cubic field. We give an explicit formula for the Dirichlet\n\
  series $\\sum_K|\\Disc(K)|^{-s}$, where the sum is over isomorphism classes of\n\
  all quartic fields whose cubic resolvent field is isomorphic to $k$. Our work\n\
  is a sequel to an unpublished preprint of Cohen, Diaz y Diaz, and Olivier, and\n\
  we include complete proofs of their results so as not to rely on unpublished\nwork.\n\
  \  This is a companion to a previous paper where we compute the Dirichlet series\n\
  associated to cubic fields having a given quadratic resolvent."
