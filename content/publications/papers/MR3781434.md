abstract: 'We describe a normal form for a smooth intersection of two quadrics in

  even-dimensional projective space over an arbitrary field of characteristic 2.

  We use this to obtain a description of the automorphism group of such a

  variety. As an application, we show that every quartic del Pezzo surface over a

  perfect field of characteristic 2 has a canonical rational point and, thus, is

  unirational.'
