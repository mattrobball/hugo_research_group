abstract: "This paper is an expanded version of the author's lecture at the Integers\n\
  Conference 2011. We discuss the secondary terms in the Davenport-Heilbronn\ntheorems\
  \ on cubic fields and 3-torsion in class groups of quadratic fields.\nSuch secondary\
  \ terms had been conjectured by Datskovsky-Wright and Roberts, and\nproofs of these\
  \ or closely related secondary terms were obtained independently\nby Bhargava, Shankar,\
  \ and Tsimerman; Hough; Zhao; and Taniguchi and the author.\n  In this paper we\
  \ discuss the history of the problem and highlight the diverse\nmethods used to\
  \ address it."
