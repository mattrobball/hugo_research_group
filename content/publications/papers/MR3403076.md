abstract: "In the case of toric varieties, we continue the pursuit of Kontsevich's\n\
  fundamental insight, Homological Mirror Symmetry, by unifying it with the Mori\n\
  program. We give a refined conjectural version of Homological Mirror Symmetry\n\
  relating semi-orthogonal decompositions of the $B$-model on toric varieties to\n\
  semi-orthogonal decompositions on the $A$-model on the mirror Landau-Ginzburg\n\
  models.\n  As evidence, we prove a new case of Homological Mirror Symmetry for a\
  \ toric\nsurface whose anticanonical bundle is not nef, namely a certain blow-up\
  \ of\n$\\P^2$ at three infinitesimally near points."
