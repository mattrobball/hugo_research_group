abstract: 'We prove the existence of secondary terms of order X^{5/6} in the

  Davenport-Heilbronn theorems on cubic fields and 3-torsion in class groups of

  quadratic fields. For cubic fields this confirms a conjecture of

  Datskovsky-Wright and Roberts. We also prove a variety of generalizations,

  including to arithmetic progressions, where we discover a curious bias in the

  secondary term. Roberts'' conjecture has also been proved independently by

  Bhargava, Shankar, and Tsimerman. In contrast to their work, our proof uses the

  analytic theory of zeta functions associated to the space of binary cubic

  forms, developed by Shintani and Datskovsky-Wright.'
