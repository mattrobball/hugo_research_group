# Research group page using Hugo 

This repo houses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) files for generating a webpage for a research group. Some design elements were influenced by the [Allan Lab](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab) written in Jekyll. 

It has a full theme for use by research groups but things are currently set up for AGNT group at UofSC.
