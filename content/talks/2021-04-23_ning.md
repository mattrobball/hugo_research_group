title: Generalizations of Alladi's formula for arithmetical semigroups
abstract: In this talk, we will discuss a general version of Alladiâ€™s formula with Dirichlet convolution holds for arithmetical semigroups satisfying Axiom $A$ or Axiom $A^\sharp$. As applications, we apply our main results to certain semigroups coming from algebraic number theory, arithmetical geometry and graph theory. This is a joint work with Lian Duan and Shaoyun Yi.
