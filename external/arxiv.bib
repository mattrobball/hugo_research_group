 abstract = {The Orlov spectrum is a new invariant of a triangulated category. It was introduced by D. Orlov building on work of A. Bondal-M. van den Bergh and R. Rouquier. The supremum of the Orlov spectrum of a triangulated category is called the ultimate dimension. In this work, we study Orlov spectra of triangulated categories arising in mirror symmetry. We introduce the notion of gaps and outline their geometric significance. We provide the first large class of examples where the ultimate dimension is finite: categories of singularities associated to isolated hypersurface singularities. Similarly, given any nonzero object in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface, we produce a new generator by closing the object under a certain monodromy action and uniformly bound this new generator's generation time. In addition, we provide new upper bounds on the generation times of exceptional collections and connect generation time to braid group actions to provide a lower bound on the ultimate dimension of the derived Fukaya category of a symplectic surface of genus greater than one.},

 abstract = {We provide a factorization model for the continuous internal Hom, in the homotopy category of $k$-linear dg-categories, between dg-categories of equivariant factorizations. This motivates a notion, similar to that of Kuznetsov, which we call the extended Hochschild cohomology algebra of the category of equivariant factorizations. In some cases of geometric interest, extended Hochschild cohomology contains Hochschild cohomology as a subalgebra and Hochschild homology as a homogeneous component. We use our factorization model for the internal Hom to calculate the extended Hochschild cohomology for equivariant factorizations on affine space.
  Combining the computation of extended Hochschild cohomology with the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism and a theorem of Orlov recovers and extends Griffiths' classical description of the primitive cohomology of a smooth, complex projective hypersurface in terms of homogeneous pieces of the Jacobian algebra. In the process, the primitive cohomology is identified with the fixed subspace of the cohomological endomorphism associated to an interesting endofunctor of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the hypersurface. We also demonstrate how to understand the whole Jacobian algebra as morphisms between kernels of endofunctors of the derived category.
  Finally, we present a bootstrap method for producing algebraic cycles in categories of equivariant factorizations. As proof of concept, we show how this reproves the Hodge conjecture for all self-products of a particular K3 surface closely related to the Fermat cubic fourfold.},

Under assumptions on the variation, we show the derived categories are comparable by semi-orthogonal decompositions and describe the complementary components. We also verify a question posed by Kawamata: we show that $D$-equivalence and $K$-equivalence coincide for such variations. The results are applied to obtain a simple inductive description of derived categories of coherent sheaves on projective toric Deligne-Mumford stacks. This recovers Kawamata's theorem that all projective toric Deligne-Mumford stacks have full exceptional collections. Using similar methods, we prove that the Hassett moduli spaces of stable symmetrically-weighted rational curves also possess full exceptional collections. As a final application, we show how our results recover Orlov's $\sigma$-model/Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence.},

 abstract = {Over a non-closed field, it is a common strategy to use separable algebras as invariants to distinguish algebraic and geometric objects. The most famous example is the deep connection between Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras. For more general varieties, one might use endomorphism algebras of line bundles, of indecomposable vector bundles, or of exceptional objects in their derived categories.
  Using Galois cohomology, we describe a new invariant of reductive algebraic groups that captures precisely when this strategy will fail. Our main result characterizes this invariant in terms of coflasque resolutions of linear algebraic groups introduced by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. We determine whether or not this invariant is trivial for many fields. For number fields, we show it agrees with the Tate-Shafarevich group of the linear algebraic group, up to behavior at real places.},

We prove this conjecture for arithmetic toric varieties over general fields. We also investigate a slight generalization of this conjecture, where the endomorphism algebras of the exceptional objects are allowed to be separable field extensions of the base field. We show this generalization is false by exhibiting a geometrically rational, smooth, projective threefold over the the field of rational numbers that possesses a full \'etale-exceptional collection but not a rational point. The counterexample comes from twisting a non-retract rational variety with a rational point and full \'etale-exceptional collection by a torsor that is invisible to Brauer invariants.
