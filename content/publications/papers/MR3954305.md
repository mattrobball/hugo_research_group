abstract: 'We classify all possible automorphism groups of smooth cubic surfaces over
  an

  algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. As an intermediate step

  we also classify automorphism groups of quartic del Pezzo surfaces. We show

  that the moduli space of smooth cubic surfaces is rational in every

  characteristic, determine the dimensions of the strata admitting each possible

  isomorphism class of automorphism group, and find explicit normal forms in each

  case. Finally, we completely characterize when a smooth cubic surface in

  positive characteristic, together with a group action, can be lifted to

  characteristic zero.'
