abstract: 'We consider the set of forms of a toric variety over an arbitrary field:

  those varieties which become isomorphic to a toric variety after base field

  extension. In contrast to most previous work, we also consider arbitrary

  isomorphisms rather than just those that respect a torus action. We define an

  injective map from the set of forms of a toric variety to a non-abelian second

  cohomology set, which generalizes the usual Brauer class of a Severi-Brauer

  variety. Additionally, we define a map from the set of forms of a toric variety

  to the set of forms of a separable algebra along similar lines to a

  construction of A. Merkurjev and I. Panin. This generalizes both a result of

  M.~Blunk for del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6, and the standard bijection between

  Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras'
