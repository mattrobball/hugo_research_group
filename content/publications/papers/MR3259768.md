abstract: 'Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields. We prove two lower bounds

  on the maximum of the degrees of the irreducible complex representations of

  ${\rm Gal}(L/K)$, the sharper of which is conditional on the Artin Conjecture

  and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Our bound is nontrivial when $[K :

  \mathbb{Q}]$ is small and $L$ has small root discriminant, and might be

  summarized as saying that such fields can''t be "too abelian."'
