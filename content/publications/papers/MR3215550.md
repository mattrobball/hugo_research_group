abstract: "Let k be a quadratic field. We give an explicit formula for the Dirichlet\n\
  series enumerating cubic fields whose quadratic resolvent field is isomorphic\n\
  to k.\n  Our work is a sequel to previous work of Cohen and Morra, where such formulas\n\
  are proved in a more general setting, in terms of sums over characters of\ncertain\
  \ groups related to ray class groups. In the present paper we carry the\nanalysis\
  \ further and prove explicit formulas for these Dirichlet series over Q.\nIn a companion\
  \ paper we do the same for quartic fields having a given cubic\nresolvent.\n  As\
  \ an application (not present in the initial version), we compute tables of\nthe\
  \ number of S_3-sextic fields E with |Disc(E)| < X, for X ranging up to\n10^23.\
  \ An accompanying PARI/GP implementation is available from the second\nauthor's\
  \ website."
