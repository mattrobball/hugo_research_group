The exchange of ideas through regular seminar talks is an important part of the AGNT group. Our seminars feature both internal and external speakers. We strive for an open environment where everyone learns something meaningful from each talk. If you are interested in participating in one of our seminars, please contact us. 

The full {{<year>}} schedule for our main seminar can be found [here]({{<year>}}/). Below you can find information for the next scheduled talk.
