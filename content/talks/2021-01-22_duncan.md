title: Cremona groups and representation dimension
abstract: The Cremona group of rank n is the group of birational automorphisms of n-dimensional projective space. Alternatively, the Cremona group is the group of automorphisms of a purely transcendental extension. The Cremona group is famously huge and cannot be embedded in any matrix group when n is greater than one. However, their finite subgroups are much more manageable.  I discuss upper and lower bounds on the complexity of finite subgroups of Cremona groups via representation theory. This is joint work with Christian Urech.
