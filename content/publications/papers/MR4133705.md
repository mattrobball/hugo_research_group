abstract: 'Generalizing the work of A. Morra and the authors, we give explicit formulas

  for the Dirichlet series generating function of $D_{\ell}$-extensions of odd

  prime degree $\ell$ with given quadratic resolvent. Over the course of our

  proof, we explain connections between our formulas and the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla

  conjecture, the Ohno-Nakagawa relation for binary cubic forms, and other

  topics. We also obtain improved upper bounds for the number of such extensions

  (over Q) of bounded discriminant.'
