title: Cellular Resolutions for Monomial Ideals
abstract: Minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals have been an active area of study for many decades now. In the 90's, Bayer and Sturmfels considered monomial ideals whose minimal free resolutions are supported on so-called cellular complexes. It turns out that this property is quite special - in general, there exist monomial ideals whose minimal free resolution cannot be supported even on a CW-complex. In this talk, we will discuss some recent results on the cellularity of certain classes of "rainbow" monomial ideals, including a characterization of when such ideals have linear minimal free resolutions. This yields applications to polarizations of graded Artinian ideals and, after specialization, a large class of equigenerated squarefree monomial ideals admitting cellular resolutions. Much of this work is joint with Ayah Almousa.
