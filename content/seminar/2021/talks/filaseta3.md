title: Number theoretic problems arising from a graph theoretic investigation (part 2)
abstract: The two speakers will take turns addressing results related to graphs which can be drawn on a plane (not necessarily planar graphs - the edges of ours can cross) in such a way that all the edges have the same length.  We discuss how some natural Diophantine questions arise in connection with the venerable Hadwiger-Nelson Problem, aka the "chromatic number of the plane" -- questions which can be resolved by elementary applications of Galois theory.  The background for Galois theory is easy enough to be explained during the talk.  As an example, we will find all solutions to the equation $\cos( \pi x ) + \cos( \pi y ) = 1/2$ where $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers.  This is joint work with Sarah (Kaylee) Weatherspoon.
