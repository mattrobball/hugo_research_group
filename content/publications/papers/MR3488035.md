abstract: 'Generalizing Eisenbud''s matrix factorizations, we define factorization

  categories. Following work of Positselski, we define their associated derived

  categories. We construct specific resolutions of factorizations built from a

  choice of resolutions of their components. We use these resolutions to lift

  fully-faithfulness statements from derived categories of Abelian categories to

  derived categories of factorizations and to construct a spectral sequence

  computing the morphism spaces in the derived categories of factorizations from

  Ext-groups of their components in the underlying Abelian category.'
