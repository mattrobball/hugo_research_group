abstract: 'We provide descriptions of the derived categories of degree $d$ hypersurface

  fibrations which generalize a result of Kuznetsov for quadric fibrations and

  give a relative version of a well-known theorem of Orlov. Using a local

  generator and Morita theory, we re-interpret the resulting matrix factorization

  category as a derived-equivalent sheaf of dg-algebras on the base. Then,

  applying homological perturbation methods, we obtain a sheaf of

  $A_\infty$-algebras which gives a new description of homological projective

  duals for (relative) $d$-Veronese embeddings, recovering the sheaf of Clifford

  algebras obtained by Kuznetsov in the case when $d=2$.'
