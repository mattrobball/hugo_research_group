abstract: "Let (G, V) be a prehomogeneous vector space, let O be any G(F_q)-invariant\n\
  subset of V(F_q), and let f be the characteristic function of O. In this paper\n\
  we develop a method for explicitly and efficiently evaluating the Fourier\ntransform\
  \ of f, based on combinatorics and linear algebra. We then carry out\nthese computations\
  \ in full for each of five prehomogeneous vector spaces,\nincluding the 12-dimensional\
  \ space of pairs of ternary quadratic forms. Our\ncomputations reveal that these\
  \ Fourier transforms enjoy a great deal of\nstructure, and sometimes exhibit more\
  \ than square root cancellation on average.\n  These Fourier transforms naturally\
  \ arise in analytic number theory, where\nexplicit formulas (or upper bounds) lead\
  \ to sieve level of distribution results\nfor related arithmetic sequences. We describe\
  \ some examples, and in a companion\npaper we develop a new method to do so, designed\
  \ to exploit the particular\nstructure of these Fourier transforms."
