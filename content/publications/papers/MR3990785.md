abstract: 'We begin a systematic investigation of derived categories of smooth

  projective toric varieties defined over an arbitrary base field. We show that,

  in many cases, toric varieties admit full exceptional collections. Examples

  include all toric surfaces, all toric Fano 3-folds, some toric Fano 4-folds,

  the generalized del Pezzo varieties of Voskresenskii and Klyachko, and toric

  varieties associated to Weyl fans of type $A$. Our main technical tool is a

  completely general Galois descent result for exceptional collections of objects

  on (possibly non-toric) varieties over non-closed fields.'
