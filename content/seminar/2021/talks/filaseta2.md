title: On a dense universal Hilbert set
abstract: A universal Hilbert set is an infinite set $S$ of integers having the property that for every $F(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, which is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ and of degree $\geq 0$ in $x$, we have that for all but finitely many $y_0$ in $S$, the polynomial $F(x,y_0)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.  The existence of universal Hilbert sets is due to P. C. Gilmore and A. Robinson in 1955, and since then a number of explicit examples have been given.  In this talk, we discuss a connection between universal Hilbert sets and Siegel's Lemma on the finiteness of integral points on a curve of genus at least 1, and explain how a result of K. Ford (2008) implies the existence of a universal Hilbert set S that includes almost all integers and then some.  This is joint work with Robert Wilcox.
