title: Affine group schemes
abstract: There are many ways to construct a group from a ring $R$, such as the additive group $(R,+)$, the multiplicative group $R^\times$, and matrix groups such as the general and special linear groups. In this talk, we generalize these constructions by discussing a special class of group functors known as affine group schemes. We then explore representations of affine group schemes via algebras, discuss a special case of Yoneda's Lemma, and use this lemma and a fresh perspective on groups to illustrate the relationship between affine group schemes and Hopf algebras. This talk only assumes elementary group and ring theory, so we hope for it to be accessible and informative for all!
