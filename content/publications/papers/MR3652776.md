abstract: 'In this paper we investigate the distribution of the number of primes which

  ramify in number fields of degree d <= 5. In analogy with the classical

  Erdos-Kac theorem, we prove for S_d-extensions that the number of such primes

  is normally distributed with mean and variance log log X.'
